python1-bootcamp
================

Code snippets for starting off Python (for beginners).

Aim: to introduce you to Python and make you love it. It's just a tip of the iceberg. Do not expect to be a guru/beast/ninja in 4 days (actually 4 x 2 hours)! But you will be surely way better :)

Can we do this?
